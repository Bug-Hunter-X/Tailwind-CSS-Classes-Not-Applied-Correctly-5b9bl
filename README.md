# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not correctly applied to an HTML element. The expected styling is not applied, leading to unexpected visual results.

## Bug Description

A simple HTML div element uses Tailwind CSS classes for background color, text color, hover effect, padding, and rounded corners.  However, these styles are not being applied.  The element renders without the specified styles.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up, the CSS is properly imported, and there are no conflicting styles.  A common error is to forget to include the `tailwind.css` file or not configure postcss and autoprefixer.
