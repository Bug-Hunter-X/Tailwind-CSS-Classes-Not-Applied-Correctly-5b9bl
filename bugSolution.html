The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) is correctly configured, the `tailwind.css` file is imported into the main CSS file, and that postCSS and autoprefixer are correctly set up.  Here is the corrected HTML and a sample `tailwind.config.js`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Tailwind CSS Test</title>
  <link href="output.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Hover over me
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./index.html"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Ensure that your build process correctly compiles and includes the Tailwind CSS styles.
